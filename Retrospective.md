What Went Well:
The database structure was clear and simple:
The Books, Customers, and Loans tables were organized and covered the basic system requirements.
The relationships between the tables (foreign keys) were correctly established.
Using SQLite was convenient and simple:
SQLite was chosen as a lightweight solution suitable for desktop applications or small projects.
Foreign key support (pragma foreign_keys = ON) was correctly enabled when needed.
The code is extensible:
Each function (add book, loan, return, etc.) was separated into independent functions within LibraryDB.
Easy to modify or add features such as reservations or extensions in the future.

What Didn't Go Well:
We encountered some difficulties in the development environment for some members (problem uploading to GitHub and conflict issues).
ðŸ”§ What Could Be Improved:
Improving the structure of the loans table:
Adding the loanDate and returnDate columns.

Additional Notes
The team demonstrated excellent cooperation, and morale was positive.
